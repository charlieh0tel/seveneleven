Problem from Professor Doug Brumbaugh, University of Central Florida.

A guy walks into a 7-11 store and selects four items to buy. The clerk
at the counter informs the gentleman that the total cost of the four
items is $7.11. He was completely surprised that the cost was the same
as the name of the store. The clerk informed the man that he simply
multiplied the cost of each item and arrived at the total. The
customer calmly informed the clerk that the items should be added and
not multiplied. The clerk then added the items together and informed
the customer that the total was still exactly $7.11.

What are the exact costs of each item?
